## 🔍 Search & Filters

- Search by **recipe title**
- Filter by **difficulty level**:  
  `All | Easy | Medium | Hard`


---

## 📱 Responsiveness

- Fully responsive layout  
- Works on **desktop**, **tablet**, and **mobile**  


---

## ⚠️ Error Handling & Validation

- Prevents invalid form submissions  
- Shows clear error messages  
- Handles corrupted or missing `localStorage` data gracefully  
- Fallback default dataset if needed

---

## ▶️ How to Run the App

1. **Download or clone** the source code.  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).  
3. No server is required—everything runs fully on the client.

---

## 📝 Assumptions & Limitations

- All data persists only in **localStorage** → clearing browser storage deletes all recipes.
- No backend or authentication is implemented.
- Images are referenced via URLs (no file upload).
- Designed for browsers that support modern JavaScript (ES6+).

---

## 🐞 Known Issues

- Very large datasets may impact performance due to client-only storage.
- Image URLs are not validated beyond basic checks.
- If `localStorage` is blocked or disabled, the app cannot function.
